Problems with regular SMS marketing:

	1.	It's SPAM: people didn't ask for the notifications e.g. new cell phone contracts, insurance etc.
	2.	Expensive to implement: large investment to develop SMS platform. Small businesses cannot lay out that kind of money.
	3.	Difficult to setup subscribers of the SMS i.e. have to fill out paper work, get an account (e.g. with Spar or Woolworths).

Benefits or solutions offered by Figlut:

	1.	It's not spam: people subscribe by themselves for the notifications they want and can also unsubsribe any time they want.
	2.	No investment: not necessary for small business to invest in the development of their own SMS platform.
	3.	Easy to setup: people SMS a code to a phone number and they automatically get subscribed to notifications for a specific organization.
